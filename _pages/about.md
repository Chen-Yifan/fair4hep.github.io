# About the FAIR4HWP project

The primary focus of this project is to advance our understanding of the relationship between data and artificial intelligence (AI) models by exploring relationships among them through the development of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) frameworks. Using high-energy physics (HEP) as the science driver, this project will develop a FAIR framework to advance our understanding of AI, provide new insights to apply AI techniques, and provide an environment where novel approaches to AI can be explored.

This project is an interdisciplinary, multi-department, and multi-institutional effort. This project aligns with the DOE's initiative to advance FAIR data principles that focuses on making AI data and models more accessible and reusable by application developers and researchers to further accelerate AI research and development. Through this award, the interdisciplinary and multi-institutional team of experts will lead the definition and adoption of FAIR principles for AI models and data in the context of HEP.

This project is supported by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.
